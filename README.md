need to restart the server by "npm start" for some updates. Is this behavior for Window OS only?

Yes, it would automatically updated in ubuntu 20.14 OS.

For each component in index.js, the space is one empty line inbetween. Adding <p></p> would not add additional space. I think top margin should be used instead.
